# My Portfolio Projects
This repository includes all Data Analysis projects I've ever made.
I hope they let you know my skills better:
• SQL - basic level (joins, cte, window functions)
• Python - basic level (pandas, matplotlib, numpy)
• MS Excel - basic level (VLOOKUP, pivot tables)
• Business notations (DFD, IDEF0, IDEF3)
